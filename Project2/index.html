    <h1>My Home Page</h1>
    <p>After graduating from high school and college I wish to become a Electrical Engineer who works in housing. I would want to work in housing because I have experience calculating it and seeing how it is done with the ACE mentorship program. This makes me want to do this because it seems to be really interesting and fun</p>
    <h2>Examples of what I would do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>System Design</li>
      <li>Power Systems</li>
      <li>Lighting and Controls</li>
      <li>Safety System</li>
      <li>Energy Efficiency</li>
      <li>Project Management</li>
    </ul>
