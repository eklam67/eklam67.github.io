        <h2><strong>Why these foods?</strong></h2>
        <p>
          A cheeseburger has good buns, meat, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes all mixed together.
          Sushi has a great combination of fish and rice. Ramen has a great broth and meat combination.
          A burrito combines meat and tortilla together excellently.

        <h3><strong>Why I am so in love with food</strong></h3>
        <p>
          My parents always cooked amazing food when they would come home from a day of work. 
          This would be the time that I would spend the most with my family. This has caused me 
          to enjoy every meal and the food that comes with it. This is especially true as I'm going 
          to college soon and won't be able to eat with my family as much. This is why I love food so much 
          and all the things that come together to make amazing food.
